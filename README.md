# Udacity-Android-Project-3-Super-Duo
This is the third project in Udacity's Android Nanodegree.
In this project I improved two apps: 

Alexandria: A book list and barcode scanner app.  
Football Scores : An app that tracks current and future football matches (soccer, for students in the USA).

This project demonstrates the ability to do the following:  

*Diagnose existing issues with an app.  
*Make an app accessible to sight-impaired users.  
*Allow an app to be localized for distribution in other countries.  
*Handle error cases in Android.  
*Add a widget to an app experience.  
*Leverage the functionality of a library in an app.
